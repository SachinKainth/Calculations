# Number Calculations

Using C#, write some code to:
* Read the file contents into memory

Avoiding built in methods like .Sum, .Average etc, write your own algorithms to 
* Calculate the arithmetic mean 
* Calculate the standard deviation
* Compute the frequencies of numbers in bins of 10 (histogram   0  to  <10,  10  to <20 etc.)
